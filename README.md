# clientformyserver.cs is updated due to missing line and no one even asked in issue detected my self that i had deleted a line mistakenly and uploaded it so i update it on 23042022 so have fun.

# on 13.04.2022 source code is also added at this date now dont have to download receivestream.exe just compile it yourself on visual studio c# and sra6.java contain code of server you can compile it at android studio cheers. this is the simplest way to do it other people compile dozens of .java files to confuse new students.

A SERVER INSTALABLE ON ANDROID AND A CLIENT RUNABLE ON PC ENJOY
INSTAL APP-DEBUG.APK U CAN ALSO DEBUG IT TO GET CODE

NO ADB COMMAND INVOLVED.

ENJOY
